In this file we are seeing how can we read data of blockchain , write data on blockchain 
get access of data of events of blockchain and see particular data related to indexed keyword 
with the help of Ethers.js.

So we are learning how to perform all the things mentioned above with the help of Ethers.js

We have our smart contract which is Contract.sol , we have made this here for our reference
as we need to deploy our contract on blockchain , here we are deploying our contract on testnet
which could be ether seploia or goerli.

                            IMPORTANT NOTE

Always remember on which blockchain network you deployed the contract like goerli or sepolia 
use RPC URL of the same network , if you deploy the contract on goerli network then use
RPC URL of goerli network and so on.

WE need ABI of contract it is important to interact with contract , and we can get the
ABI of contract by deploying it either with the truffle or hardhat or we can also get
the ABI of a smart contract through our remix ide , there is a separate option for this.

For getting the RPC URL go to infura or alchemy and there create an account and then create a 
new key and choose the network(goerli mainnet or sepolia) on which our smart contract is deployed
because then only we can interact with our deployed smart contract.

In transfer.json we have a json file , in which our ABI is present , therefore to access our ABI
store the ABI as we have done inside our project.
